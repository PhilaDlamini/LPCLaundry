LPCLaundry is a mobile application built for Li Po Chun United World College of Hong Kong to help streamline the laundry process.

Students at Li Po Chun can see machine availability before going to the laundry room, and can queue up to do laundry right from the app. When their turn comes, they are notified and can then go to the laundry room and do their laundry.

LPCLaundry is built with Flutter, allowing it to run on both iOS and Android.
